# Pack My Sprite!
A basic png sprite packer

Creates a .png spritesheet!  
* __The name of the spritesheet is the `first` line__ of 'spritelist.txt'.  
* __The size of the spritesheet is the `second` line__ of 'spritelist.txt'.  

Drag the app to the folder with your sprites in it, then run it once to create the default 'spritelist.txt'.
