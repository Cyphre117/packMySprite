# Pack My Sprite!
A basic png sprite packer

Creates a .png spritesheet 2048x2048 that is from a list of 256x256 .png images

Drag the app to the folder with your sprites in it, then run it once to create the default 'spritelist.txt'.

Modify 'spritelist.txt' so that the first line is the name of the spriteSheet you want to create, and each subsequent line is a sprite you want in the sprite sheet, in the correct order.
